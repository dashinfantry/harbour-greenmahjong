# harbour-greenmahjong
A revival of an old, failed mahjong game for sailfish os. It's an html app wrapped in QT QML.

This version works :) In landscape and portrait mode :)

The naming is somewhat confusing, but it's designed to help people using Sailfish, override the install from an old broken version.

My QML version is in the main a wrapper around:

I have tried to leave that untouched.
